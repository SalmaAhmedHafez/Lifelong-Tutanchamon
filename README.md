# Lifelong Tutankhamun - A Pharaoh Reborn in Code
*"The sands of time have preserved my story, and now technology gives me voice. I am Tutankhamun, and I await your questions in this new digital realm."*

## About This Project
The opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum inspired me to create this project. I wanted to find a new way for people to connect with history. Instead of just looking at old objects in a museum, I thought it would be amazing if you could actually talk to them.

That's why I built this AI version of Tutankhamun. Now anyone can have a real conversation with the famous pharaoh, ask questions about his life, and learn history in a more personal and engaging way.
