## About This Project
The opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum inspired me to create this project. I wanted to find a new way for people to connect with history. Instead of just looking at old objects in a museum, I thought it would be amazing if you could actually talk to them.

That's why I built this AI version of Tutankhamun. Now anyone can have a real conversation with the famous pharaoh, ask questions about his life, and learn history in a more personal and engaging way.

- Ask questions about ancient Egyptian history
- Get responses in English or Arabic
- Learn about pharaohs, pyramids, and daily life in ancient Egypt

## Example Questions to Ask

- "How old were you when you became pharaoh?"
- "What artifacts were found in your tomb?"
- "Tell me about the Grand Egyptian Museum"
- "ما هي أهم المقتنيات في مقبرتك؟" (Arabic)

## Technology Used

- **Python** with FastAPI for the web server
- **LangChain** for AI conversation management
- **Google Gemini AI** for natural language processing
- **Modular code structure** for easy maintenance
- **Finally build a simple HTML page** for testing.
